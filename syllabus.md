# Introduction to Mediterranean Art

This introductory-level course examines art historical methods and their application to a broad roughly chronological survey of Mediterranean art and architecture from Prehistory to the Middle Ages. Field trips to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts enhance the understanding of historical traditions and critical methods taught in class lectures and discussions.
