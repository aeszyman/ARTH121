## Course Description
This introductory-level course examines art historical methods and their application to a broad, roughly chronological survey of Mediterranean art and architecture from Prehistory to the Middle Ages. Field trips to the Science Museum of Virginia, Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, and Boatwright Memorial Library (Rare Book Room Space) enhance the understanding of historical traditions and critical methods taught in class lectures and discussions.

In this course, which situates major works of premodern art and architecture in their historical contexts, students gain an understanding of the impact of disparate cultures and societies on their physical and epistemological environments. Every week, students critically analyze and discuss primary sources, both visual and textual. By emphasizing topics such as artistic 
patronage, the rise and fall of empires, urban development, ritual practices, and organized religious movements, this course fosters students' understanding of each discussed culture's social structures and cultural norms that informed and were shaped by the material and visual culture of the time. The content and assignments for this class focus on the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe from prehistoric to medieval times.

This course satisfies the General Education category of Historical Studies (FSHT).

## Historical Studies (FSHT)
Historical studies examine events and actors of the recent or distant past within the context of the ideas, institutions, social norms, cultural practices, and physical environments out of which they arose. Courses with a historical perspective enable us to understand the values and institutions of disparate societies and cultures as they have developed over time.

By emphasizing the critical analysis of sources and the interrelationships among ideas, institutions, social structures, and events within one or more interpretive frameworks, these courses foster students' awareness of the methods and perspectives for understanding past societies and cultures in historical context. Courses that focus narrowly on the history of a discipline, that only use chronology as an organizational structure, or that do not stress the context in which ideas and events occurred fall outside the category of historical studies.

## Learning Goals
Although this course includes an overview of major monuments and works of art, its main objective is to equip students with skills of historical research and interpretation. In this course, students learn to apply methods of historical studies as they critically analyze key examples of material and visual culture produced by premodern societies and cultures. For example, to understand the historical context of Gothic cathedrals, students read primary sources that portray the construction process of these monuments in terms of social harmony or disruption. The students' critical analysis of these primary sources enables them to nuance their understanding of not only the social impact of architectural monuments, but also of the historical context that led to their completion. Through a combination of lecture presentations, in-depth group discussions of primary sources, museum visits, and writing assignments, students gain an understanding of the historical contexts, as well as social and cultural practices out of which arose the canonical monuments and artworks of the premodern Mediterranean region.

## Class Discussion
Research demonstrates that when you participate in class discussion, it benefits you. Most of you will pursue careers that require you to work in teams. To be an effective team member, one must be able to engage in dialogue, learn from colleagues, and help deal with challenges as a group. It is OK to challenge and refute ideas or positions, but not acceptable to attack someone personally or engage in name-calling.

## Course Policies
The use of cell phones and recording devices is prohibited.

The use of laptops is discouraged. If you absolutely need to use a laptop, you may only do so to take notes or pull up files relevant to class.
