## What if you can't make it?
If you can't join us on Friday, August 30, at 5:15 pm, you are required to visit the exhibit on your own and submit a 1-page analysis of the exhibit [Pompeii: The Immortal City](https://www.smv.org/explore/exhibits/pompeii-the-immortal-city). The exhibit closes on September 3, and your assignment is due no later than September 5. Note that this is different from what I said to some of you who already informed me that they had a scheduling conflict.
