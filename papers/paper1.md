To complete this paper, you must visit the [Virginia Museum of Fine Arts](https://www.vmfa.museum/) (VMFA). Note that we will visit VMFA together on September 13, and you may use that visit as an opportunity to begin your work on this paper. Browse the Galleries of Ancient and Medieval Art. Select an artwork that piques your interest. The artwork has to fall within the geographic and temporal boundaries of this course. Make a detailed  annotated drawing of the selected artwork and take a selfie with it, but be careful not to back into it. Examine the artwork and write down your detailed observations. Record the information presented in the museum label, including the artwork's accession number.

Write a visual analysis of the selected artwork's formal elements. A formal analysis includes an analysis of the forms appearing in the work you have chosen. These forms give the work its expression, message, or meaning. To aid in writing a formal analysis, you should think as if you were describing the work of art to someone who has never seen it before. When your reader finishes reading your analysis, she should have a complete mental picture of what the work looks like. Certain basic terms, which are listed below, are indispensable for describing artworks and buildings of any time and place. They make up the essential vocabulary of formal analysis, the visual analysis of artistic form. Here are the terms that you should consider in your formal analysis:
* form and composition
* material and technique
* line
* color
* texture
* space, mass, and volume
* perspective and foreshortening
* proportion and scale
Note that not all of the terms listed above are applicable to every artwork. For example, not every artwork uses foreshortening. Consult pp. 1-13 in the textbook for more information about formal elements and on how to analyze them.

The formal analysis is more than just a description of the work. It should also include a thesis statement that reflects your conclusions about the work.  The thesis statement may, in general, answer a question like these:  What do I think is the meaning of this work? What is the message that this work or artist sends to the viewer? What is this work all about? The thesis statement is an important element. It sets the tone for the entire paper, and sets it apart from being a merely descriptive paper.
